Zeta is a cryptocurrency exchange that allows you to jump between different blockchain networks easily and securely. With Zeta, you don't need KYC or intermediaries. You only need to indicate which wallet you want to receive your money in, without connecting your wallet and exposing yourself to security risks. Zeta is the ideal platform for users who want to take advantage of the opportunities of cryptocurrencies, regardless of their level of experience or knowledge. Zeta is the easiest jump.


The entire process is outlined in the following diagram:

## Process Explanation:


**1. User Initiation:**

Users seamlessly transfer their funds between different blockchain networks (e.g., Avax to Ethereum), ensuring a secure and private experience. By avoiding the need to connect their wallets, users benefit from increased security and privacy. Additionally, they receive the most competitive rate available through our fedge pricing system.

**2. User Transaction:**

To initiate a transaction, users send funds to the provided wallet address and subsequently inform us of the sending wallet address. This allows Zeta to connect the user's action with the relevant on-chain smart contract, ensuring a smooth and efficient transaction process.

**3. On-chain Smart Contract (Price Feed + CCIP):**

Upon receiving the designated amount of token A, the smart contract leverages Chainlink Price Feed from the oracle to determine the equivalent amount of token B to be delivered. This information is then relayed to Chain II through Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP) messaging.

**4. On-chain Smart Contract II (Price Feed + CCIP):**

The smart contract on Chain II processes the received message, extracts the intended recipient and token amount, and initiates the token B sending function. This ensures the seamless and accurate execution of the cross-chain transaction.

**5. Transaction**

The Graph platform records all transaction events, including user funds received, providing an endpoint for displaying liquidity and execution details. While this information is readily available, user access is optional and does not impact the transaction flow.

**Note:** During the MVP phase of this project, Zeta acts as the sole liquidity provider. All transactions will be executed upon user initiation and confirmation.

The project prioritizes an enhanced user experience and design through Nouns style and vibes.

This is just an example of how we implement Nouns Vibes using Lil Noun Asset Library on Figma to build the design prototype ‚ö°Ô∏è

By implementing this decentralized cross-chain exchange with expanded protocol support, including Uniswap V4 and CELO, we revolutionize the way users transfer funds across networks. Our approach ensures security, efficiency, and accessibility across diverse platforms, while the CELO integration provides an attractive annual incentive for users engaging with our ecosystem.

In the development of the FastSwaps, we used the following technologies:


* [![Next][Next.js]][Next-url] | React
* [![Chakra][chakra-ui]][chakra-url] | BOS Near
* [![Node][Node.js]][Node-url]

Node.js 
Mongo BD
CELO


These powerful tools and frameworks have helped us create a seamless user experience and ensure the scalability and reliability of our platform.
